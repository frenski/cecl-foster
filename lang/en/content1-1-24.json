{"texts":{"content_text0":"Case Study Intro","content_text200":"Ana is a 7-year-old girl who was discovered by local authorities late one evening walking between cars at a busy intersection, asking drivers for money. She appeared frightened, poorly dressed for the weather, and unable to explain where she lived.","content_text201":"After intervention by child protection services, it became clear that Ana was a victim of forced labour and child exploitation. Ana does not speak the language of the country where she was found and struggles to communicate due to a severe speech impediment. No parents or guardians could be identified.","content_text202":"During the first contact with officials, Ana became visibly distressed when asked repeated questions. She could not understand what was happening and had no trusted adult present. Professionals quickly realised that treating Ana like an adult witness would risk re-traumatising her and undermining both her recovery and the investigation.","content_text203":"A multidisciplinary response is organised involving child-protection services, specialised police officers, psychologists, interpreters, and a court-appointed guardian. The goal is not only to investigate the crime, but also to ensure Ana\u2019s recovery, dignity, and best interests throughout the justice process."}}
